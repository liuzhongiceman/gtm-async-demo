# Dynamically loading Google Tag Manager environments in a single page application
Demo of the approach described in [this article](https://medium.com/p/a9ae7550d042)

## Quick start:
- Install the dependencies:
```yarn```

- Start the development server:
```yarn start```

- Navigate to localhost:8080

- The app loads the GTM container specified in config.js, which contains a tag that outputs some copy firing on the `ViewLandingPage` event.
